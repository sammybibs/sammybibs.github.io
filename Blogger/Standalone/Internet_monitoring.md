## Introduction 
19 April 2023

My ISP here in the UK is average at best, my internet is up and down quite often. Before I open a case and complain, i'd like to gather evidence of where the issue resides.

For this I will setup two scripts, one to run in my home network to ping some IP on the internet and react accordingly. Another will run online, likely AWS to ping both my public IP and an inside host, then react accordingly to gather evidence when down.
