Have the initial homepage of the server ask for the password and cache it for that session in a variable.

If you hardcore a password in yml that will be preferd

If the yml file has a integer in ip index 0 then use that, else resolve hostname.

(Later add full check for valid IP & if fail connect try dns, and catch exertions)

(Also add to the python error logging and remove print statements)
