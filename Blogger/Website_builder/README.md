# The background story

As part of the DNAC API tool, i needed a way to front end this. Sure there are lots of platforms out there, but whats more fun it to delve into this void myself and see what I can create. So here is the idea:

1. Find a suitable .com domain name
2. Find a suitable back end storage location (github)
3. Automate as much of the workloads as possible
4. Prettify the whole front end
